Интересные новости — Трэвис Каланик [заключил договор с компанией](https://www.recode.net/2017/8/3/16092864/travis-kalanick-hires-ceo-advisory-firm-teneo-pr-improve-his-tarnished-image), занимающейся консультированием руководителей компаний.

[blockquote source="Recode"]Ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has hired high-profile “CEO advisory” firm Teneo to help him manage his own embattled interests, according to several sources close to the situation.

So, get ready for some positive stories on the embattled entrepreneur via open-hearted interviews (except to heartless Recode, because we always get left out of those for being too mean to delicate tech executives)!

Enter Teneo, which was founded by a trio of execs — Declan Kelly, Doug Band and Paul Keary — with close ties to Democratic power players like Bill and Hillary Clinton. They have branched out with a variety of services in 12 divisions and — via a combination of hiring big-name “formers” (former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former NYC top cop William Bratton) — have attracted giant corporate clients such as Dow Chemical.

According to a 2016 New York Times story on the firm, which has attracted some controversy itself: “Teneo bills itself as the chief executive’s best friend. Its pitch is that, with Teneo’s help, C.E.O.s can become not just business leaders but ‘thought leaders and global ambassadors,’ according to its website.”

Indeed, right on its homepage now is a bromide that would appeal to Kalanick, who has been mired in trouble for his dysfunctional management of the car-hailing company: “50% of a company’s reputation is created or lost by its CEO. Where’s reputation management on your agenda?”[]



Кара Свишер предполагает, что Трэвис собирается заняться восстановлением своего пострадавшего в последнее время имиджа и строит планы возвращения на прежний пост — тем более, что пока что поиски Uber нового кандидата на должность генерального директора откровенно неуспешны.
